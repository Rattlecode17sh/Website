                   <i> Iron Man, Thor, the Hulk and the rest of the Avengers 
                    unite to battle their most powerful enemy yet -- the 
                    evil Thanos. On a mission to collect all six Infinity 
                    Stones, Thanos plans to use the artifacts to inflict his 
                    twisted will on reality. The fate of the planet and existence
                    itself has never been more uncertain as everything the Avengers
                    have fought for has led up to this moment.</i>
